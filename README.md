# Game of Life

## Description
The Game of Life
Rules: Cells are either 'alive' or 'dead'
       
       When they are alive, this is represented by coloring the cell black
       
       Live cells stay alive when they have exactly 2 or 3 neighbors,
           if they have more they 'die' from overcrowding,
           and if they have less they 'die' from loneliness.
       
       A non-live cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors.
  
This game was invented by John Conway, and it creates some cool visuals
  
## Purpose
This is my first JavaScript project that I made without any outside direction or motivation.
The process of creating this helped me sharpen my JavaScript skills, specifically practice
with 2D arrays and updating the DOM tree.
